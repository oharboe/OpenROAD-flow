## Introduction
The OpenROAD ("Foundations and Realization of Open, Accessible Design") project
was launched in June 2018 within the DARPA IDEA program. OpenROAD aims to bring
down the barriers of cost, expertise and unpredictability that currently block
designers' access to hardware implementation in advanced technologies. The
project team (Qualcomm, Arm and multiple universities and partners, led by UC
San Diego) is developing a fully autonomous, open-source tool chain for digital
layout generation across die, package and board, with initial focus on the
RTL-to-GDSII phase of system-on-chip design. Thus, OpenROAD holistically attacks
the multiple facets of today's design cost crisis: engineering resources, design
tool licenses, project schedule, and risk.

The IDEA program targets no-human-in-loop (NHIL) design, with 24-hour turnaround
time and eventual zero loss of power-performance-area (PPA) design quality. No
humans means that tools must adapt and self-tune, and never get stuck: thus,
machine intelligence must replace today's human intelligence within the layout
generation process. 24 hours means that problems must be aggressively decomposed
into bite-sized subproblems for the design process to remain within the schedule
constraint. Eventual zero loss of PPA quality requires parallel and distributed
search to recoup the solution quality lost by problem decomposition.

For a technical description of the OpenROAD flow, please refer to our DAC paper:

Project](https://vlsicad.ucsd.edu/Publications/Conferences/371/c371.pdf). Also,

## Code Organization
This repository serves as an example RTL-to-GDS flow using the OpenROAD tools.
The two main components are:
1. **tools**: This directory contains the source code for the entire `openroad`
   app (via submodules) as well as other tools required for the flow. The script
   `build_openroad.sh` in this repository will automatically build the OpenROAD
   toolchain.

2. **flow**: This directory contains reference recipes and scripts to run      |
   designs through the flow. It also contains platforms and test designs.

## Setup
The flow has the following dependencies:
* OpenROAD
* KLayout
* TritonRoute
* Yosys

The dependencies can either be obtained from a pre-compiled build export or
built manually. See the [KLayout website](https://www.klayout.de/) for
installation instructions.

### Option 1: Installing build exports in CentOS 7
1.  Clone the OpenROAD-flow repository
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow.git
```
2. Navigate to the "Releases" tab and download the latest release
3. Extract the tar to `OpenROAD-flow/tools/OpenROAD`
4. Update your shell environment
```
source setup_env.sh
```

### Option 2: Building the tools using Docker from any operating system
This build option leverages a multi-step docker flow to install the tools and
dependencies to a runner image. To follow these instructions, you must have
docker installed, permissions to run docker, and docker container network access
enabled. This step will create a runner image tagged as `openroad/flow`.
1.  Clone the OpenROAD-flow repository
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow.git
```
2. Ensure your docker daemon is running and `docker` is in your PATH, then run
the docker build. Plan 1 hour or so for this step on a modern machine with a good
internet connection.
```
cd OpenROAD-flow
./build_openroad.sh
```
3. Start an interactive shell in a docker container using your user credentials. This
maps the OpenROAD-flow folder into the docker image to allow you to manipulate the
files that the docker image operates on from the docker host machine.
```
docker run -it -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) openroad/flow bash
```
4. The command below runs a quick smoketest by pointing OpenROAD-flow to a folder with Verilog files
and telling OpenROAD which module to use as a top-level Verilog module. The top level file
must have signal named "clock". Start with a tiny sub-module to see that it goes through the
the entire OpenROAD flow and produces a GDS file.
```
./openroad-smoketest path-to-verilog-files/ TopLevelName
```

### Option 3: Building the tools locally
1. Reference the Dockerfiles and READMEs for the separate tools on the build steps
and dependencies.
```
OpenROAD-flow/tools/OpenROAD/Dockerfile
OpenROAD-flow/tools/yosys/Dockerfile
OpenROAD-flow/tools/TritonRoute/Dockerfile
```
See the [KLayout](https://www.klayout.de) instructions for installing KLayout from source.

2. Run the build script
```
./build_openroad.sh
```
3. Update your shell environment
```
source setup_env.sh
```
`klayout` must be added to the path manually.

## Using the flow
See the flow [README](flow) for details about the flow and how
to run designs through the flow

## Contributing
We welcome any comments, patches and designs to help us improve the tool. At
this time we are focused on overhauling the build process, build testing, and
the continuous integration framework. This will set us up for better integration
with contributors. Please stay tuned.
